                are the surviving dispatchers from US Pro Support, a team established almost 3 years ago. With the help and dedication of OM Anthony, Coach Bino and Mr. Sandoval,
                a chance was given to provide these agents not only an opportunity but also a challenge to support Dell sites around the said region.
                Out of the 10 remaining agents, 4 came from the pioneer batch of dispatchers who are familiar, comfortable, and proficient on reviewing every pending dispatches,
                while others have the same ability learned through out the years. The team will make sure all reviewed dispatches will receive enough support and even send feedback if necessary
                for the front-line agents to be more compliant as possible. This will be a new career of the team in Dell and a new reminder to always be grateful each day.
